# AI-Book-by-Docusaurus

A comprehensive guide to **AI & Spec-Driven Software Development** - transforming how developers build software with AI-powered code generation and specification-driven architecture.

## About This Project

This book explores the intersection of:

- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence** - Using AI assistants for code generation
- 📋 **Specifications** - Clear, formal definitions of system behavior
- ✅ **Verification** - Automatic testing and validation
- 📚 **Documentation** - Self-documenting code through specs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000/` and automatically reloads when you make changes.

### Build

Generate static content for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates optimized static HTML files into the `build` directory, ready for deployment.

### Serve Locally

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```
